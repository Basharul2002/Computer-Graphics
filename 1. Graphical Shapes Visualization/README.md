# ðŸŽ¨ Computer Graphics: OpenGL Shapes Visualization

This project demonstrates the rendering of various geometric shapes using **OpenGL**. The program displays these shapes on a 2D plane divided into four quadrants by middle lines.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Screen Division**: The screen is divided into four quadrants using horizontal and vertical middle lines.
- **Shapes Displayed**:
  - **Top-Left Quadrant**: A red triangle.
  - **Top-Right Quadrant**: A yellow hexagon.
  - **Bottom-Left Quadrant**: A blue rectangle.
  - **Bottom-Right Quadrant**: A cyan upside-down triangle.
- **Black Background**: Provides a clear contrast for the displayed shapes.
- **Simple Design**: Shapes are evenly distributed in their respective quadrants for clarity.

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

1. **Middle Lines**: The vertical and horizontal lines divide the screen into quadrants.
2. **Geometric Shapes**:
   - **Triangle** in the top-left quadrant.
   - **Hexagon** in the top-right quadrant.
   - **Rectangle** in the bottom-left quadrant.
   - **Upside-Down Triangle** in the bottom-right quadrant.

## ðŸ“¸ Visualization
The rendered output showcases the following features:
- Clear geometric shapes with distinct colors.
- Balanced arrangement of shapes across the quadrants.
- Crisp rendering using **OpenGL**.

## ðŸŒŸ Additional Details

- **OpenGL** and **GLUT** libraries are used for rendering.
- The program runs in a 500x500 pixel window.
- Shapes are drawn with precise vertices and colors for visual distinction.
