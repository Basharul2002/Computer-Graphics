# Line Drawing Algorithms
This project provides a C++ implementation of several common line drawing algorithms, each designed to calculate and plot points between two specified points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` on a 2D plane.

## Features

The program provides a menu-based interface for users to:
1. Draw a **Diagonal Line** using a basic approach
2. Draw a **Horizontal Line** by incrementing the x-coordinate
3. Draw a **Vertical Line** by incrementing the y-coordinate
4. Draw a line using the **DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)** algorithm
5. Draw a line using the **Midpoint Line Algorithm**

For each algorithm, the program calculates the intermediate points and outputs the coordinates of the line from the starting point to the ending point.

## Usage

### 1. Input the Coordinates
- Enter the starting point `(x1, y1)` and the ending point `(x2, y2)`

### 2. Select an Option
- Choose an option from the menu to draw a specific type of line

### 3. View the Result
- The program outputs the calculated points for the selected line

### 4. Retry or Exit
- After each run, you can choose to try again or exit the program

## Functions

### Main Functions

- **`Display()`**  
  Displays the menu and handles user input

- **`TryAgain()`**  
  Prompts the user to retry or exit the program

### Line Drawing Algorithms

1. **Diagonal Line**  
   Draws a diagonal line by incrementing both x and y coordinates

2. **Horizontal Line**  
   Draws a horizontal line by incrementing the x-coordinate

3. **Vertical Line**  
   Draws a vertical line by incrementing the y-coordinate

4. **DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)**  
   Draws a line using the DDA algorithm, which calculates intermediate points based on the slope

5. **Midpoint Line Algorithm**  
   Draws a line using the Midpoint Line Algorithm, which uses a decision parameter `p` to determine the next point

## Sample Menu
```
What do you want? 
1. Diagonal Line 
2. Horizontal Line 
3. Vertical Line 
4. DDA 
5. Midpoint 
Choose option: 
```

## How It Works

1. The user selects an option from the menu.
2. Depending on the chosen algorithm, the program calculates and prints the points for the selected line
3. The user is prompted to try again or exit the program

## Code Structure

### Headers and Macros
- `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: Includes all standard headers
- `#define endl "\n"`: Shortcut for newline

### Function Prototypes
Defined at the beginning for better organization

### Core Functions
Each function is implemented to compute the points for a specific type of line

### Recursive Approach
- Functions like `DiagonalLine`, `HorizontalLine`, and `VerticalLine` use recursion to calculate the points

## Example Output

```
Enter the value of x1: 0
Enter the value of y1: 0
Enter the value of x2: 5
Enter the value of y2: 5
What do you want? 
1. Diagonal Line 
2. Horizontal Line 
3. Vertical Line 
4. DDA 
5. Midpoint 
Choose option: 1
0 0

2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
Do you want to try again? (y/n): n
Goodbye!

## Line Drawing Algorithm Simulations

### **1. Diagonal Line Algorithm Simulation**
For points `(x1, y1) = (0, 0)` and `(x2, y2) = (5, 5)`:

The **Diagonal Line Algorithm** simply increments both x and y coordinates by 1 in each step, drawing a line with equal changes in both coordinates (slope = 1)

The points generated by this algorithm are:

```
Starting Point: (0, 0)
Step 1: (1, 1)
Step 2: (2, 2)
Step 3: (3, 3)
Step 4: (4, 4)
Ending Point: (5, 5)
```

### **2. Horizontal Line Algorithm Simulation**
For points `(x1, y1) = (0, 3)` and `(x2, y2) = (5, 3)`:

The **Horizontal Line Algorithm** keeps the y-coordinate constant and increments the x-coordinate in each step.

The points generated by this algorithm are:

```
Starting Point: (0, 3)
Step 1: (1, 3)
Step 2: (2, 3)
Step 3: (3, 3)
Step 4: (4, 3)
Ending Point: (5, 3)
```

### **3. Vertical Line Algorithm Simulation**
For points `(x1, y1) = (3, 0)` and `(x2, y2) = (3, 5)`:

The **Vertical Line Algorithm** keeps the x-coordinate constant and increments the y-coordinate in each step.

The points generated by this algorithm are:

```
Starting Point: (3, 0)
Step 1: (3, 1)
Step 2: (3, 2)
Step 3: (3, 3)
Step 4: (3, 4)
Ending Point: (3, 5)
```

### **4. DDA Algorithm Simulation**
For points `(x1, y1) = (2, 3)` and `(x2, y2) = (10, 8)`:

The **DDA Algorithm** calculates the intermediate points by incrementing the x and y coordinates at each step based on the slope of the line.

- `dx = 10 - 2 = 8`
- `dy = 8 - 3 = 5`
- `steps = max(abs(dx), abs(dy)) = 8`
- `xIncrement = dx / steps = 8 / 8 = 1.0`
- `yIncrement = dy / steps = 5 / 8 = 0.625`

The points calculated by the DDA algorithm are:

```
Starting Point: (2, 3)
Step 1: (3, 3.625)
Step 2: (4, 4.25)
Step 3: (5, 4.875)
Step 4: (6, 5.5)
Step 5: (7, 6.125)
Step 6: (8, 6.75)
Step 7: (9, 7.375)
Step 8: (10, 8) -> Ending Point
```

### **5. Midpoint Line Algorithm Simulation**
For points `(x1, y1) = (2, 3)` and `(x2, y2) = (10, 8)`:

The **Midpoint Line Algorithm** uses a decision parameter `p` to determine the next point along the line.

- `dx = 10 - 2 = 8`
- `dy = 8 - 3 = 5`
- `p = 2 * dy - dx = 2 * 5 - 8 = 2`

The points calculated by the Midpoint Line Algorithm are:

```
Starting Point: (2, 3)
Step 1: (3, 3)
Step 2: (4, 3)
Step 3: (5, 3)
Step 4: (6, 4)
Step 5: (7, 4)
Step 6: (8, 5)
Step 7: (9, 5)
Step 8: (10, 6) -> Ending Point
```

### Conclusion

Both the **DDA Algorithm** and the **Midpoint Line Algorithm** produce different intermediate points for the line from `(2, 3)` to `(10, 8)` due to their distinct methods of calculating the next point.
